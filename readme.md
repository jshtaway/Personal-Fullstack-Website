This personal website showcasing some skills and accomplishments I have. 
It uses node/express backend with a mySQL database connection and React front end. This readme is available as a description of this website and how to use it. And will also show up as a pdf on the github repo page as popup description.

## Getting Started

Download the project and install the dependencies. After everything is installed you can start all 3 servers (React, Node/Express, and MySQL) by running "npm run dev" in the node_app folder. You will need your own password files, which I reference in my code, but obviously haven't included.

### Prerequisites

MySQL, node, react. For more dependencies, check out the package.json files:

![Node package.json](https://github.com/zen-gineer/server-client-playground/blob/master/node_app/package.json)

![React (client) package.json](https://github.com/zen-gineer/server-client-playground/blob/master/node_app/client/package.json)



## Deployment
